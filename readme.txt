Add to WooCommerce an automatic city name generated from postcode.

== Description ==
**IMPORTANT: *WC - APG City* isn't compatible with Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 or earlier.**

**WC - APG City** adds to your WooCommerce shop a new automatic city field generated from postcode via GeoNames API or Google Maps API.

= Features =
* Fully compatible with the Checkout block in the WordPress block editor.
* Includes a local GeoNames database that is downloaded and updated monthly to improve performance and reduce external API queries.
* You can choose between the GeoNames API or the Google Maps API.
* You must add your own Google Maps API Key or GeoNames username.
* You can customize the default text of the select field.
* You can customize the text of the option used to reload a text field.
* You can block modifications to the city and province (state) fields.
* You can customize the background color of the locked fields.
* If the postal code is shared by more than one city, the customer will be able to select the correct city name from the list returned by GeoNames or Google Maps.
* If the city is not in the list or cannot be found in either API, the customer can manually enter their city name.
* It also selects the province (state), as long as the name matches the one obtained from GeoNames or Google Maps.
